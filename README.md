# GuruTest 

This is a Developer Challenger, builded with a php framework Codeigniter version 4, with an igniter starter-package and hosted with Apache

# The Objective
Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Guru". For multiples of 5 print "IT". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "Gurus".

But here's the catch: you can use only one if. No multiple branches, ternary operators or else.

Requirements

1 if
You can't use 'else', 'else if' or ternary

Unit tests
You can write the challenge in any language you want. Here at Linio we are big fans of PHP, Kotlin and TypeScript

Submission
You can create a public repository on your GitHub account and send the link to us, or just send us a zip file.
